# Terso

> dependency injection hooks for React.

*Terso* is a pragmatic hook and HOC library for React, that provides dependency injection to a React application. 
It uses [inversify js](https://inversify.io/) as an IoC container, in combination with [mobx](https://mobx.js.org/) for state management.

Is it a revolutionary library? No! It is just a collection of functions, born with the sole need of not wanting to copy/paste the same code into different projects.
